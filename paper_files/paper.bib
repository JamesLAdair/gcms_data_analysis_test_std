   abstractNote={One of the most commonly used clustering algorithms within the worldwide pharmaceutical industry is Jarvis−Patrick’s (J−P) (Jarvis, R. A. IEEE Trans. Comput. 1973, C-22, 1025−1034). The implementation of J−P under Daylight software, using Daylight’s fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index, can deal with sets of 100 k molecules in a matter of a few hours. However, the J−P clustering algorithm has several associated problems which make it difficult to cluster large data sets in a consistent and timely manner. The clusters produced are greatly dependent on the choice of the two parameters needed to run J−P clustering, such that this method tends to produce clusters which are either very large and heterogeneous or homogeneous but too small. In any case, J−P always requires time-consuming manual tuning. This paper describes an algorithm which will identify dense clusters where similarity within each cluster reflects the Tanimoto value used for the clustering, and, more importantly, where the cluster centroid will be at least similar, at the given Tanimoto value, to every other molecule within the cluster in a consistent and automated manner. The similarity term used throughout this paper reflects the overall similarity between two given molecules, as defined by Daylight’s fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index.},

   abstractNote={Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) followed by catalytic hydrotreating of the produced biocrude is increasingly gaining ground as an effective technology for the conversion of biomass into liquid biofuels. A strong advantage of HTL resides in its great flexibility towards the feedstock, since it is able to treat a large number of different organic substrates, ranging from dry to wet residual biomass. Nevertheless, the characteristics of biocrudes from different typologies of organic materials result in different challenges to be met during the hydrotreating step, leading to differences in heteroatoms removal and in the typology and composition of the targeted products. In this work, biocrudes were catalytically hydrotreated with a commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at different temperatures and pressures. Sewage sludge biocrude was found to be very promising for the production of straight-chain hydrocarbons in the diesel range, with considerable heteroatoms removal even at mild hydrotreating conditions. Similar results were shown by algal biocrude, although complete denitrogenation is challenging. Upgraded biocrudes from lignocellulosic feedstock (miscanthus) showed high yields in the gasoline range, with a remarkable content of aromatics. Operating at a higher H2 pressure was found to be crucial to prevent coking and decarboxylation reactions.}, journal={Renewable Energy},

   abstractNote={2D fragment-based similarity searching is one of the most popular techniques for searching a large database of chemical structures and has been widely applied in drug discovery. However, its performance, especially its effectiveness in retrieving active structural analogues, has not been adequately studied. We report a series of computational experiments, where we systematically studied the influence of structural descriptors and similarity coefficients on the effectiveness of similarity searching. The study was conducted using two public large data sets, NCI anti-AIDS and MDDR. Four sets of 2D linear fragment descriptors, based on the original definitions of atom pairs and atom sequences, were compared. The effect of using the Tanimoto coefficient and the Euclidean distance was studied as a function of descriptor set. The results clearly indicate that the Tanimoto coefficient is superior to the Euclidean distance in 2D-fragment based similarity searching, in terms of hit rate, while atom sequences demonstrate the best overall performance among the structural descriptors we studied.},

   abstractNote={Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most promising methods of the production of renewable fuels. However, an optimization of the conditions of bio-oil production is not possible without comprehensive analysis of the composition of formed products. There are several methods for the determination of distribution of products formed during thermal decomposition of biomass with chromatography being the most versatile among them. Although, due to the complex structure of bio-oil (presence of hundreds chemical compounds with different chemical character), an interpretation of the obtained chromatograms is not an easy task. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present an application of different chromatographic methods to the analysis of the composition of the mixture of products formed in high temperature decomposition of lignocellulosic feedstock. It includes pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), two dimensional gas (GC x GC) or liquid chromatography (LC x LC) and initial fractionation of bio-oil components. Moreover, the problems connected with the analysis of bio-oils formed with the use of various fast pyrolysis reactors and capabilities of multivariate analysis are discussed.},

   abstractNote={Effective catalytic hydrotreatment of highly nitrogenous biocrudes derived from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of primary sewage sludge and microalga Spirulina biomass was explored. A critical issue is the lack of thermal stability of raw HTL biocrudes at the severe conditions (~400 °C) required for hydrodenitrogenation. This fact suggests the need for a two-stage approach, involving a first low-temperature stabilization stage followed by another one operated at higher temperature. In this study, DSC was successfully used to indicate the thermal stability of both biocrudes. During hydrotreating, it was observed that complete deoxygenation was already achieved in the first stage at 350 °C, with limited coke formation. Moreover, after second stage up to 92% denitrogenation associated with the higher hydrogen consumption (39.9 g kg −1 for Spirulina and 36.9 g kg −1 for sewage sludge) was obtained for both biocrudes. Consequently, comparable oil yields but significantly less coke yields were recorded during two-stage upgrading (1.0% for Spirulina and 0.7% for sewage sludge), compared to direct processing at 400 °C (9.1% for Spirulina and 3.4% for sewage sludge). In addition, the properties of the upgraded oils were enhanced by increasing the temperature in the first stage (310 °C, 330 °C and 350 °C respectively). Finally, the results indicated that remarkable drop-in fuel properties were obtained, with respect to heteroatom (O and N) removal, HHV, and H/C ratio during the two-stage hydrotreatment. Two-stage hydrotreating is therefore proposed as a successful approach for the upgrading of HTL biocrudes with high nitrogen content.}, journal={Biomass and Bioenergy},

   abstractNote={Bio-oil contained a large number of macromolecular compounds like asphalt, which made it difficult to obtain accurate results from direct test analysis. In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) bio-oil of Spirulina (300 °C, 30 min, 10 MPa) was underwent column chromatography separation (CCS) process to retain the macromolecular substances in the column, which improved the accuracy of subsequent analysis results. The obtained fractions were characterized by Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TG), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, Elemental Analysis, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy Analysis. TG analysis showed that a significant amount of components coexisting in high-boiling-range residue in bio-oil could be isolated into quasi-gasoline and quasi-kerosene species, so the low boiling-point fractions of bio-oil between 30-250 °C increased. GC-MS proved that CCS could effectively separate bio-oil and the number of detected components in bio-oil increased from 25 to 109 after CCS. The results of elemental analysis and FT-IR indicated that the components of the bio-oil were separated according to the polarity , and the higher heating values(HHVs) of each distillate oil (38.32-42.19 MJ kg−1) was significantly higher than the bio-oil before CCS (31.83-36.04 MJ kg−1). Comprehensive results of multiple analysis could help determine the market application prospects of bio-oil. In addition, tert-hexadecanethiol was studied as a representative Sulphur-compound to surmise its generation mechanism. The speculation of the conversion pathway of sulphur (S) element could provide a basis for a better understanding of the HTL reaction mechanism.}, journal={Fuel},

   abstractNote={Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) can thermochemically transform sewage sludge into a biocrude with high energy content, high chemical complexity, and high O and N content. The development of an efficient upgrading process for such complex feedstocks necessitates detailed knowledge of the molecular composition and the specific heteroatom-containing compounds to understand and optimize the hydrotreating reactions. In this study, we present the upgrading of sewage sludge-derived HTL biocrude via a two-stage hydrotreatment process and perform advanced chemical characterization of the feedstock, intermediate, and final upgraded products with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR–MS). We show that hydrotreatment significantly improves the quality of the oil, primarily succeeding in cracking the heavy molecules and removing the sulfur- and oxygen-containing components. FTICR–MS analysis shows that the HTL biocrude has a high concentration of fatty acid amides that readily lose their oxygen and nitrogen during hydrotreating and are converted into saturated hydrocarbons, whereas the aromatic OxNy compounds are converted into N1 and N2 classes, which are more resistant to hydrotreating. We also demonstrate that the upgraded HTL oil can be successfully blended with intermediate refinery streams, such as vacuum gas oil (VGO), for further co-processing to in-spec fuels in conventional processes. This provides an alternative route to introduce renewable carbon in existing fossil-based refineries.},

   abstractNote={Before biobased fuels can replace fossil fuels, several key issues must be addressed. Bio-oils derived through pyrolysis of lignocellulosic material have high acidity and viscosity, and poor energy density and stability. To address these issues, this paper examines the individual and combined behavior of lignocellulosic feedstock components to shed light on the potential to generate preferential biofuel properties through biomass mixing. Dry lignocellulosic biomass is mostly composed of cell wall polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), which vary widely in type and concentration across biomasses. This heterogeneity leads to increased unpredictability in biobased fuel formation during pyrolysis. Using derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and residual gas analysis, this work explores the synergistic interactions of lignocellulosic biomass components during pyrolysis to manipulate bio-oil and gas product composition based on desired compound classes. Cellulose, xylose, xylan, and lignin were blended at different ratios to determine the extent of synergistic effects during pyrolysis. For each mixture, an ‘expected’ outcome was developed by summing the individual behavior (e.g. mass loss rate, H2 gas evolution, etc.) of the individual components based on mass fraction present. Mixtures containing lignin and/or xylan yield peak DTG mass loss rates at lower temperatures than predicted with corresponding reductions in biochar yield suggesting synergistic interactions that promote devolatilization. By itself, lignin produces large amounts of hydrogen gas, and when mixed with other biomasses promotes dehydrogenation. Lignin increases CO2 formation, resulting in lower oxygen concentrations in the bio-oil and biochar. While suppressing bio-oil generation, the presence of lignin – even at low concentrations – increases the number of phenol compounds produced, while decreasing the yield of furans. The synergistic interactions between different polysaccharides could be exploited depending on the desired biorefinery products – allowing for targeted selection of lignocellulosic biomass mixes to fine-tune resulting fuels.}, journal={Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis},

   abstractNote={Aqueous phase recirculation (APR) during the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process is a means to enhance HTL performance and lower the need for intensive residual water treatment. However, the obtained HTL bio-crude cannot be considered a drop-in biofuel partially due to its significant heteroatom content. Thus, catalytic hydrotreating is typically practised to upgrade HTL bio-crude to drop-in biofuel/biofuel precursors. This study establishes a holistic overview of the influence of APR on hydrotreated bio-crude. The employed strategy integrates a four-step APR process to a batch catalytic hydrotreating process operating at mild (350 °C) or severe conditions (400 °C). APR revealed promising results in terms of bio-crude yield and energy recovery. However, the heteroatom content of the resulting bio-crude was noticeably elevated. Regardless of the operational conditions, hydrotreating experiments disclosed a higher oil yield while treating the first cycle’s bio-crude along with limited coke formation. Although the added oxygen content by APR was offset through hydrotreating, the nitrogen content of the hydrotreated bio-crude in the consecutive cycles significantly increased. The elemental distribution results revealed that APR increased the nitrogen distribution in the hydrotreated bio-crude. Hence, higher quantities of hydrogen and severe hydrotreating conditions were required to obtain a suitable drop-in quality of the biofuel.},

Water, methanol, ethanol, butanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, toluene, and hexane were used as solvents in which the liquefaction was performed. It was observed that all resulting oils demonstrate a considerable degree of similarity. For all samples, compounds containing 1 and 2 nitrogen atoms dominated in the positive ESI spectra, while a relative contribution of other compounds was small. In negative ESI mode, compounds having 2 to 7 oxygens were observed. Statistical analysis revealed that products can be combined in two groups depending on the solvent used for the liquefaction. To the first group, we can attribute the products obtained by using protic (alcohols) and to the second by using aprotic (acetonitrile, toluene) solvents. Nevertheless, based on our results, we concluded that solvent possesses a minor impact on molecular composition of bio-oil. We suggested that the driving force of the liquefaction reaction is the thermal dehydration of the carbohydrate in algae, resulting in water formation, which could be the trigger of the producing of bio-oil. To prove this hypothesis, we performed the reaction with the dry algae in the absence of the solvent and observed the formation of bio-oil.},

   abstractNote={Solid wastes of organic origins are potential feedstocks for the production of liquid biofuels, which could be suitable alternatives to fossil fuels for the transport and heating sectors, as well as for industrial use. By hydrothermal liquefaction, the wet biomass is partially transformed into a water-immiscible, oil-like organic matter called bio-oil. In this study, an integrated NMR spectroscopy/mass spectrometry approach has been developed for the characterization of the hydrothermal liquefaction of bio-oil at the molecular level. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used for the identification of functional groups and gauging the aromatic carbon content in the mixture. GC–MS analysis revealed that the volatile fraction was rich in fatty acids, as well as in amides and esters. High-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) has been applied in a systematic way to fully categorize the bio-oil in terms of different classes of components, according to their molecular formulas. Most importantly, for the first time, by using this technique, and for the liquefaction bio-oil characterization in particular, FT-MS data have been used to develop a methodology for the determination of the aromatic versus aliphatic carbon and nitrogen content. It is well known that, because they resist hydrogenation and represent sources of polluting species, both aromatic molecules and nitrogen-containing species raise concerns for subsequent upgrading of bio-oil into a diesel-like fuel.},

Although the main components of LCBM are cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, the chemicals derived from LCBM differ significantly due to the various feedstock and methods used for the decomposition. Biooil, produced from pyrolysis of LCBM, contains hundreds of organic chemicals with various classes. This review covers the methodologies used for the componential analysis of biooil, including pretreatments and instrumental analysis techniques. The use of chromatographic and spectrometric methods was highlighted, covering the conventional techniques such as gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. The combination of preseparation methods and instrumental technologies is a robust pathway for the detailed componential characterization of biooil. The organic species in biooils can be classified into alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, benzene-ring containing hydrocarbons, ethers, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, and other heteroatomic organic compounds.

Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is used to analyze the complex aqueous phase. Especially small organic acids and nitrogen-containing compounds are of interest. The efficient derivatization reagent methyl chloroformate was used to make analysis of the complex aqueous phase from hydrothermal liquefaction of dried distillers grains with solubles possible. A circumscribed central composite design was used to optimize the responses of both derivatized and nonderivatized analytes, which included small organic acids, pyrazines, phenol, and cyclic ketones. Response surface methodology was used to visualize significant factors and identify optimized derivatization conditions (volumes of methyl chloroformate, NaOH solution, methanol, and pyridine). Twenty-nine analytes of small organic acids, pyrazines, phenol, and cyclic ketones were quantified. An additional three analytes were pseudoquantified with use of standards with similar mass spectra. Calibration curves with high correlation coefficients were obtained, in most cases R2 > 0.991. Method validation was evaluated with repeatability, and spike recoveries of all 29 analytes were obtained. The 32 analytes were quantified in samples from the commissioning of a continuous flow reactor and in samples from recirculation experiments involving the aqueous phase. The results indicated when the steady-state condition of the flow reactor was obtained and the effects of recirculation. The validated method will be especially useful for investigations of the effect of small organic acids on the hydrothermal liquefaction process.},

Group contribution methods link the target property to contributions based on chemical groups or other molecular subunits of a given molecule. However, the fragmentation of the molecule into its subunits is usually done manually impeding the fast testing and development of new group contribution methods based on large databases of molecules. The aim of this work is to develop strategies to overcome the challenges that arise when attempting to fragment molecules automatically while keeping the definition of the groups as simple as possible. Furthermore, these strategies are implemented in two fragmentation algorithms. The first algorithm finds only one solution while the second algorithm finds all possible fragmentations. Both algorithms are tested to fragment a database of 20,000+ molecules for use with the group contribution model Universal Quasichemical Functional Group Activity Coefficients (UNIFAC). Comparison of the results with a reference database shows that both algorithms are capable of successfully fragmenting all the molecules automatically. Furthermore, when applying them on a larger database it is shown, that the newly developed algorithms are capable of fragmenting structures previously thought not possible to fragment.},

   title={Selectivity of Bio-oils Catalytic Hydrotreatment Assessed by Petroleomic and GC*GC/MS-FID Analysis},
   volume={27}, ISSN={0887-0624}, url={https://doi.org/10.1021/ef302145g}, DOI={10.1021/ef302145g},
   abstractNote={We propose to assess the selectivity of hydrotreatment catalysts by two complementary analytical methods: (1) high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), called “petroleomic” analysis, by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT ICR, 9.4T) MS for species heavier than m/z of about 200 Da and (2) quantitative GC*GC (heart-cutting)/MS-flame ionization detector (FID) analysis of lighter species. The methodology is illustrated on methanol-soluble bio-oils produced by lignin pyrolysis and hydrotreated by iron-based catalysts. GC*GC analysis is calibrated by a combination of internal standard and prediction of response factors on the FID. Laser desorption ionization (LDI) and electro spray ionization (ESI) in negative-ion mode are combined for the petroleomic analysis. The selectivity of hydrotreatment (catalytic fixed bed, 1 atm, 400 °C) is assessed as a function of catalyst loads and iron support (silica and activated carbon). Hundreds of species are analyzed by GC*GC and petroleomic and mapped in Van Krevelen diagrams. The high selectivity of reduced iron for the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin pyrolysis vapors is demonstrated. The effect of the catalytic treatment on oxygen content and unsaturation is studied for a broad range of species: from C2 to C14 by GC analysis and from C8 to C37 by petroleomic. Many heavy lignin oligomers produced by the pyrolysis are trapped by the catalytic bed, highlighting the need of new catalytic systems to convert them into valuable fuels or chemicals.},

   abstractNote={In this study the aqueous phases resulting from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass and the hydrotreatment (HT) of fast pyrolysis bio-oils were analyzed via TC, COD, GC-MS, GC-FID, HPLC, and ICP-OES to determine the organic and inorganic species present and the quantitative amounts of each. This work is necessary to address a significant knowledge gap in the literature related to the aqueous phases from thermochemical processes. Results showed that water from the hydrotreatment of eight different bio-oils contained less than 1 wt% total carbon, in many cases less than 0.2%. Negligible organic carbon was observed. HTL samples contained between 1 and 2 wt% carbon. Due to the large volume of water added to the HTL feedstock and the dilute samples generated, this accounts for 34–45% of the total carbon sent to the reactor. The majority of this carbon was present as acids, with glycolic acid and acetic acid having the highest concentrations. Alcohols, specifically methanol and ethanol, were also present. Numerous ketones were observed, consisting of mainly acetone and cyclopenta-ones. The amount of the total carbon identified and quantified in the HTL samples ranged from 64 to 82%. Inorganic species present in the HT samples were sodium, silicon, and sulfur. The highest levels of sulfur were observed in the grasses and agricultural residue (corn stover). The HTL samples exhibited much higher inorganic content, with very high levels of sodium and potassium. Alkali and alkali earth metals, as well as sulfur, were also present at levels high enough to raise concerns for the use of catalysts in downstream upgrading or reforming processes.}, journal={Biomass and Bioenergy},

   abstractNote={In the present study, pyrolysis of corn stover lignin was investigated by using a micro-pyrolyzer coupled with a GC–MS/FID (FID=flame ionization detector). The system has pyrolysis-vapor residence times of 15–20 ms, thus providing a regime of minimal secondary reactions. The primary pyrolysis product distribution obtained from lignin is reported. Over 84 % mass balance and almost complete closure on carbon balance is achieved. In another set of experiments, the pyrolysis vapors emerging from the micro-pyrolyzer are condensed to obtain lignin-derived bio-oil. The chemical composition of the bio-oil is analyzed by using GC–MS and gel permeation chromatography techniques. The comparison between results of two sets of experiments indicates that monomeric compounds are the primary pyrolysis products of lignin, which recombine after primary pyrolysis to produce oligomeric compounds. Further, the effect of minerals (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2) and temperature on the primary pyrolysis product distribution is investigated. The study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lignin pyrolysis and a basis for developing more descriptive models of biomass pyrolysis.},

   abstractNote={Large-scale commercialization of drop-in biofuel technologies requires a deeper understanding of the molecular structure of biocrude oils and their compatibility with fossil crudes in terms of molecular interactions that govern miscibility. For the first time, the compatibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) derived biocrude obtained from pinewood with straight-run gas oil (SRGO) was comprehensively investigated by theoretical prediction using Hansen double sphere plots and experimental confirmation from miscibility studies to achieve a biofeed compatible for coprocessing at refineries. The Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) for biocrude, biocrude components (residue and light and heavy distillate fractions), and SRGO were determined by plotting a three-dimensional Hansen solubility sphere plot based on the experimental solubility data obtained on their solubility studies in 38 different solvents. The compatibility of HTL biocrude oil with SRGO was verified from the solubility distance (Ra) and relative energy difference (RED) values obtained from the center of their Hansen spheres and difference in HSPs, respectively, in a Hansen double sphere solubility plot. The experimental data obtained on miscibility studies confirmed that pyridine, cyclohexanone, and a pyridine–cyclohexanone solvent mixture (1:1) occupy a well-defined Hansen space and show fitting to HSPs of the biocrude–SRGO blend, improve the overall compatibility of the blending mixture, and display a maximum miscibility of 72%. To correlate the compatibility with the molecular structure, the compatibility of light, heavy, and residual fractions obtained by fractional distillation of HTL biocrude (pinewood) was also evaluated with SRGO using the Hansen double sphere plot, and a close agreement with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results as well as the experimental data on miscibility studies was verified. Furthermore, the comprehensive estimation of the detailed composition and chemical nature of biocrude and light, heavy, and residual fractions by the means of elemental (CHN/O), GC-MS, and GC × GC analysis was also presented. Additionally, the correlation between compatibility and interactions within chemical functionalities of blend components was established by analyzing the contribution of aromatic, aliphatic, and oxygen containing functional groups to the miscibility using quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The present study reports a mixing strategy to assess the compatibility of biocrudes, heavy distillate fractions, asphaltenes, residues, and polymers with existing petroleum infrastructure for the cost-effective biorefinery process to balance economic and environmental considerations.},

   abstractNote={Mechanistic-based optimization of hydrothermal liquefaction for simultaneous energy and nutrient recovery provides an opportunity for sustainable agricultural and food industry operations.          ,                           Valorization of agricultural and food waste digestates is crucial for sustainable waste management to reduce environmental impacts and improve the economics of commercial farms. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of anaerobic digestates was evaluated to recover resources by converting them into carbon-dense biocrude oil and a nutrient-rich HTL aqueous phase (HTL-AP) coproduct. The effects of HTL temperature (280–360 °C), reaction time (10–50 min), feedstock pH (2.5–8.5), digestate salt content (1–5 wt%), and digestate cellulose-to-lignin ratio (0.2–1.8) on energy and nutrient recovery were systematically investigated in a set of well-designed experiments following a half-fractional central composite protocol. Response surface analysis combined with HTL product characterization and comparative literature study produced a comprehensive reaction pathway for HTL of anaerobic digestates. Moreover, this analysis revealed the importance of acidic feedstocks (pH 3.00–5.53), high reaction temperatures (337–360 °C), and reaction times <45 or 45–50 min for digestates with Cel/Lig >1 or <1, for maximizing the energy recovered in biocrude (high carbon yield and low heteroatom content) and the amounts of P, NH              3              –N, and Mg distributed in the HTL-AP. Acidic conditions catalyzed biocrude production, inhibited the Maillard reaction (lowering the nitrogen content in biocrude), and partitioned nutrients into the HTL-AP. Higher reaction temperatures coupled with longer reaction times activated hydro-denitrogenation and deoxygenation reactions to improve biocrude quality. This work provides not only validated methods to achieve targeted resource recovery for specific feedstock compositions using HTL, but also a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the HTL of biomass waste for controlling target product characteristics.},

   abstractNote={Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an efficient second-generation technology for conversion of biomass or biomass waste products into bio-oils for e.g. the transport sector. The product consists of a bio-oil of varying viscosity and composition, as well as aqueous and gas-phase byproducts. In order to guide optimization of the HTL process with regard to conditions, catalysts, and feedstock, there is a need for standardized methods for product analysis. We have developed analytical methods to investigate the chemical composition of bio-oils produced in a continuous HTL plant using 11 different types of feedstocks and model compounds (sucrose, cellulose, sunflower oil, casein, gluten, cellulose mixed with protein, manures, sewage sludge, and Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles, DDGS). Bio-oils and aqueous phase byproducts were analyzed directly by gas-chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), while fatty acids (C10–C18) were specifically quantified using GC (with flame ionization detection) after derivatization into their methyl esters. In addition we developed and applied a new high-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS) method for detection of fatty acids (C14–C22) in the aqueous phase byproduct. Generally HTL bio-oils had a complex composition showing 100–200 separate peaks in the GC-MS chromatograms, but for most feedstocks, 30–50 peaks accounted for a large fraction of the total peak area. Grouping of identified products into chemical families provided a useful overview for characterization of the bio-oils. Fatty acids (C16 and C18) were major products from HTL of protein (gluten), sunflower oil, DDGS, sewage sludge, and some manure feedstocks, while other important compound groups in bio-oils included phenols, cyclopentenes, indoles, pyrroles, and amides. The aqueous phase contained products such as cyclopentenones, pyrazines, and fatty acids, also found in the bio-oils, which were probably present as micelles suspended in the aqueous phase.},

   abstractNote={Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is considered as a promising thermochemical conversion technology for crude bio-oil (biocrude) production from biomass. However, the influence of downstream processing methods (such as biocrude recovery methods and solvents used) has not been investigated fully to date. In this investigation we examined the effect of solvents and extraction methods on the yield and physiochemical properties of biocrude from Chlorella sp. (C. sp.), spent coffee grounds (SCG), and a mixture of the two. It was found that the extraction method did not have a significant effect on the yield and physiochemical properties of biocrude derived from the feedstock of interest in this study. However, the solvents used for biocrude recovery had crucial effects, in which dichloromethane (DCM) was determined to the most favorable one from biocrude yield and chemical yield perspective. It was also noticed that the synergetic effects claimed for co-liquefaction of C. sp. and SCG were highly dependent on the solvent used to recover bio-crude. Overall, it is expected that this study could attract more attention on the impact of various recovery procedures on the yield/physiochemical properties of bio-oil resulting from hydrothermal liquefaction processes.}, journal={Fuel Processing Technology},

   abstractNote={Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an efficient method for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biocrude oil (BO). This study investigated the effects of temperature, reaction time, catalyst (K2CO3 or Ru/C), heating rate on product yields, quality and chemical composition of BO. Meanwhile, a comprehensive comparison of fast HTL with conventional HTL was conducted to explore the difference in reaction pathways. Higher BO yield was obtained at lower temperature (from 260 to 320 °C) and short reaction time (less than 15 min) via fast HTL of barley straw. In particularly, the catalytic HTL with K2CO3 was favorable for BO production, and the highest BO yield of 36.73% was obtained at 300 °C. As regard to the deoxygenation, the lowest O/C of 0.16 and 0.18 were observed at 380 °C with K2CO3 or Ru/C, respectively. GC/MS and NMR analysis showed that BO from fast HTL of barley straw was featured by phenols and phenolic derivatives, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Higher temperature and fast heating rate were particularly beneficial for hydrocarbons, which accounted for 15.39% of total peak area under fast HTL condition with temperature increasing to 380 °C. Meanwhile, fast heating rate dramatically increased the phenols contents (33.15% and 29.96%) at low temperature below 300 °C, which has potential for the production of phenolic resins in BO application.}, journal={Biomass and Bioenergy},
